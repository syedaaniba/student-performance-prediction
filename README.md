Student Performance Prediction
What This Does
This is a machine learning project that predicts how well students perform academically. The dataset contains information about students' demographics and their test scores in math, reading, and writing. The goal is to identify factors that influence academic success and predict outcomes for new students.

How I Did It
The project addresses two main machine learning tasks: a classification task and a regression task.

Classification (Pass/Fail Prediction)
I used a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest Classifier. The pipeline for this was:

Data Loading: The dataset was loaded, and an avg_score column was created.

Preprocessing: Categorical data was converted into numerical values that the models could understand using one-hot encoding.

Training: The data was split into training and testing sets, and the models were trained on the training data.

Evaluation: The models were evaluated on the test data using accuracy metrics.

Regression (Average Score Prediction)
For this task, I used a Random Forest Regressor to predict the exact average score. The process was similar to the classification pipeline, with the final step being evaluation using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Dataset
The dataset contains:

Gender

Race/ethnicity

Parental level of education

Type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)

Test preparation course completion status

Scores in math, reading, and writing

How to Run This Project
Prerequisites
Make sure Python is installed along with these libraries:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Steps
Clone this repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/syedaaniba/student-performance-prediction.git
Change directory into the project folder:

Bash

cd student-performance-prediction
Open the Jupyter notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook studentperformance.ipynb
Run the notebook cells one by one to perform data analysis, train the models, and view the results.

Results
Logistic Regression accuracy: ~86%

Random Forest accuracy: ~85.5%

Random Forest Regressor RMSE: ~14.78 points

Key Findings
The analysis shows these factors significantly influence student performance:

Parental education level

Completion of a test preparation course

Lunch type

Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical machine learning skills like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The models are effective at predicting student pass/fail status and average scores, which could be useful for academic interventions or support programs.
